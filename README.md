# WebHub


This is my WebHub Solution. This will contains many projects that I work that will be listed below once release.

============================================================================================

Main projects hosted on the hub:

Completed:
  
In Development:
  
  - Fashion Project
     - Outfit Generation
     - Wardrobe Catalog

============================================================================================

Current Working Design and Future Plans:

 - Currently working on version 1.x of the Web Hub.
    - 1.x Will be a monolithic style solution using Angular and Entity framework with the Web, Business, and Data Layer setup. 
    - It will have most projects all stored in a central repository for ease of development and learning.
    
 - Version 2.x will be a much more cutting edge version of the repo.
    - The project will be broken down into microservices.
    - There will be a central core which will represent the Hub.
